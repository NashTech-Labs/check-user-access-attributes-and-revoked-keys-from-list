# SSH Key Management and Auditing Template
This template is designed to assist administrators and security personnel in the systematic identification, tracking, and removal of both revoked and stale SSH keys. </br>

- Revoked keys: Revoked SSH keys are cryptographic keys that were once valid for accessing a system but have been deliberately invalidated or deactivated. This could be due to various reasons such as an employee leaving an organization, a compromised key, or a security policy change.

- Stale keys: Stale SSH keys are keys that were once valid but are now outdated or no longer in use. This can happen when an employee receives a new key, changes devices, or undergoes a key rotation process. If these old keys are not properly managed and removed, they become stale.


### Key Objectives:
- Identification of Revoked Keys:
- Detection and Handling of Stale Keys
- Documentation and Logging:
- Regular Audits and Reporting:

Tracking revoked SSH keys and identifying stale keys are important security practices in maintaining the integrity and security of a system. </br>
Regularly auditing and updating SSH key configurations are considered best practices in key management. It ensures that the organization is proactively managing access controls and reducing the likelihood of security incidents. </br>
